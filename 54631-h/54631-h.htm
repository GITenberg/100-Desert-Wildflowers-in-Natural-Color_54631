<h2 class="center" id="c1"><span class="h2line1"><i>Hints for Flower Photographers</i></span></h2>
<p>If your interest in desert flowers includes a desire to obtain beautiful photographs
of them, the following &ldquo;tips&rdquo; may be helpful.</p>
<p class="tb">MOTION is a major hazard in still photography, and flowers, especially those on
long, slender stems, seem to be constantly in motion stimulated by the ever-present
desert breeze. The practical solution to this problem is to take your photographing
jaunts, if possible, in the early morning when the air is most likely to be motionless.
A flower picture blurred by motion is a complete flop!</p>
<p>Except for motion, nothing will irritate you more often than the abrupt, frequent,
and marked CHANGES IN LIGHTING due to small clouds passing over
the sun. Again, early morning has an advantage in normally cloudless desert skies.
Clouds may be expected after 10 o&rsquo;clock on many days.</p>
<p class="tb">DEPTH OF FIELD is highly important in flower photography, and you will be
gratified with the results if you take pains to have all parts of the picture, except
the background, in sharp focus. This desirable objective has become less difficult
to attain with the advent of &ldquo;faster&rdquo; films which enable you to use the required
small diaphragm &ldquo;stop&rdquo; without too greatly reducing the shutter speed, and still
obtain adequate exposures.</p>
<p class="tb">Too many flower photographers fail to get really CLOSE UP PICTURES. A
single blossom or a small cluster of blossoms provides a much more attractive and
significant picture than an entire plant. One blossom with, perhaps, a bud, one
fruit, and a trace of foliage, if well composed, is tops among flower pictures. This
objective requires camera equipment with the ability to focus on objects close to
the lens. Also it complicates the goal of getting all parts of the picture into sharp
focus.</p>
<p class="tb">UNCLUTTERED BACKGROUNDS are a &ldquo;must&rdquo; in flower pictures. You might
consider joining the flower photographers who carry with them plain gray or variously
tinted background cards or light-weight boards. Such a card or board of
contrasting color, when placed behind the blossom, will accomplish wonders in
giving prominence to the flower. One method of obtaining a dark background is
to ask someone (if you are a contortionist you can do it yourself) to stand in such
a position as to cast a shadow on the ground or foliage behind the subject. The
sky makes an excellent background, and you will find it useful whenever you can
set your camera below the level of the subject.</p>
<p class="tb">With the foregoing points in mind, study the pictures in this booklet with the
aim of trying to surpass them in quality. By exercising care and patience, you should
be able to do so.</p>
<h2 class="center" id="c2"><span class="h2line1"><i>Introduction</i></span></h2>
<h3 id="c3"><i>The Desert</i></h3>
<p>When Webster defined a desert as a &ldquo;dry, barren region, largely treeless and
sandy&rdquo; he was not thinking of the 50,000 square mile Great American Desert of
the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Most of it is usually dry and
parts may be sandy, but as a whole, it is far from barren and treeless. Heavily vegetated
with gray-green shrubs, small but robust trees, pygmy forests of grotesque
cactuses and stiff-leaved yuccas, and myriads of herbaceous plants, the desert, following
rainy periods, covers itself with a blanket of delicate, fragrant wildflowers.
Edmund C. Jaegar, author of several books on deserts, reports that the California
deserts alone support more than 700 species of flowering plants.</p>
<p>The late Dr. Forrest Shreve, for many years Director of the Desert Laboratory
of the Carnegie Institution near Tucson, Arizona, defined a desert as &ldquo;a region of
deficient and uncertain rainfall.&rdquo; He divided the Great American Desert into four
major sections: (1) <i>Chihuahuan</i> (chee-WAH-wahn), including the Mexican States
of Chihuahua and Coahuila (coa-WHEE-lah), southwestern Texas, and south-central
New Mexico; (2) <i>Sonoran</i>, including Baja California, southwestern Arizona, and
northwestern Sonora; (3) <i>Mojave</i> (moh-HAH-vee), Colorado, including south-eastern
California and extreme southern Nevada; (4) <i>Great Basin</i>, including Nevada,
Utah, southwestern Idaho and southeastern Oregon.</p>
<p>Since the steppes and mesas of the Great Basin Desert have generally lower
temperatures, higher elevations, and greater precipitation than the other three sections,
we are not including its flowers in this work.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><i>Why and When Do Deserts Bloom?</i></h3>
<p>The Great American Desert produces, when conditions are favorable, a gorgeous
exhibition of wildflowers. Trees, shrubs, and herbs all contribute to the splendor of
the display. Soil composition, slope and exposure, suitable temperatures, and adequate
moisture are essential to plant growth and flower production.</p>
<p>Moisture is the uncertain factor, and years may pass without enough rainfall to
stimulate plant growth. Rain of less than 0.15 inch is wasted as far as desert plants
are concerned, for the moisture evaporates before penetrating the soil. Some annuals
produce seeds having water-soluble germination inhibitors in their coverings, hence
fail to sprout, even after rain, unless the moisture totals at least half an inch.</p>
<p>When soil moisture from December and January rainfall is enough to support
potential plants it dissolves the seed coats, and the desert floor is soon carpeted with
eager green seedlings. When winter rains are scant, as is so often the case, the
dormant seed population fails to germinate and the spring flower display doesn&rsquo;t
appear. There is no sure way to forecast a spectacular blossom year, for a sudden
cold wave or period of drying winds may literally nip in the bud a potential season
of brilliant bloom. A great flower year may occur only once in a decade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Perennials are more dependable than annuals, since some of them, particularly
cactuses and other succulents, have water storage tissues in their stems or roots.
These perennials may be counted on to blossom each year, but with much less
abandon than after winters of above normal precipitation. Many perennials have
surprisingly extensive root systems.
Fascinating are the ways by which plants manage to thrive under severe conditions
of desert heat and drought. As we have seen, most annuals lie dormant as seeds
until suitable moisture and temperature occur. Then they grow very rapidly, to bloom
and mature seeds while the soil still has moisture. Winter rains produce spring-blooming
ephemerals, and summer showers produce summer &ldquo;quickies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another group of plants, including the ocotillo (oh-koh-TEE-yoh), slows down
life processes to become dormant during dry periods, even to dropping all leaves.
When rains come they put on new leaves, several times a year if necessary.</p>
<p>Cactuses and other succulents gorge themselves with water when the soil is wet,
releasing moisture very sparingly from storage tissues during the &ldquo;long dry.&rdquo; Some
have discarded or reduced foliage, or have covered leaf surfaces with varnish or wax,
to decrease to a minimum the loss of vital moisture through transpiration.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><i>Identifying Desert Wildflowers</i></h3>
<p>Unless you are a botanist, identification of flowers by measuring and counting
their various parts, as described in technical keys, is generally too complicated to be
practical. Several years ago, recognizing this problem, I authored a book, <i>Flowers of
the Southwest Deserts</i>, illustrated by Jeanne R. Janish and published by the Southwestern
Monuments Association, designed to aid the wildflower fancier in plant
identification by color-grouping the flowers. With Mrs. Janish&rsquo;s superb illustrations
pointing out each plant&rsquo;s most obvious characteristics, it has proved an excellent field
guide. However, the demand for natural color flower portraits could not go unheeded,
and this book is the result. The two books complement each other, although each
fills a need in its own right. Used together, they make you more positive of some
identifications.</p>
<p>Probably the best way to become acquainted with a flower is to be introduced
to it by someone. But there is one catch to this method&mdash;one plant may be known
by many aliases.</p>
<p>When the Spaniards came into the Southwest over 400 years ago they found
Indians had names for some flowers in their own languages. The Spaniards added their
names, and later the Americans added English names. Some of these names were of
similar-appearing but quite different flowers they had known &ldquo;back East.&rdquo; Later,
scientists studied the desert plants, and gave them all Latin names.</p>
<p>To assist in standardizing names of desert flowers, this booklet gives preference
in its headings to scientific and common names found in <i>Arizona Flora</i>, by Kearney
and Peebles, Second Edition, 1960. Common names found in <i>Texas Plants, A Checklist
and Ecological Summary</i>, 1962, by F. W. Gould, also have been used. In addition,
placed within the text, are some of the more widely used common names that we have
encountered. Tree names, both common and scientific, follow the <i>Checklist of Native
and Naturalized Trees of the United States</i>, by Elbert L. Little, Jr., 1953.</p>
<p>There are many desert flowers, some quite common, for which there was not
space in this booklet. If you wish to broaden your acquaintance to include more, we
recommend, for added reading publications listed in the back.</p>
<p>The author wishes to express here sincere thanks to Mrs. Pauline M. Patraw,
Santa Fe botanist, for assistance in identifying many of the flowers pictured here. For
assistance in checking identifications, the author is indebted to Miss Barbara Lund,
Park Naturalist, National Park Service; to Dr. Charles T. Mason, Jr., Curator of the
Herbarium, University of Arizona Tucson; and to Dr. W. B. McDougall, Curator of
Botany, Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower1">1.</a> Longleaf ephedra</span></h2>
<p>Commonly called &ldquo;Mormon tea,&rdquo; there are
many species of ephedra (ef-FED-rah) growing
throughout the Southwest. This yellow-green,
stringy-stemmed shrub with tiny,
scale-like leaves, is usually 3 to 4 feet tall, but
sometimes reaches a height of 12 feet. Its
small, fragrant, springtime flowers grow in
dense clusters that attract insects. Some species
provide winter forage for cattle and are
said to be browsed by bighorn sheep. Pioneers
brewed a palatable drink from the dried
stems. Certain Indian tribes considered the
brew a tonic, beneficial for treatment of
syphilis and other diseases. The drug, ephedrine,
comes from a Chinese member of this
genus.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower2">2.</a> Common reed</span></h2>
<p>Somewhat resembling bamboo, carrizo
grows in dense thickets in marshes, along
river banks, and in other wet locations. Largest
of the grasses, it sometimes attains a
height of 12 feet. The large, tassel-like flower
heads appear from July to October and create
a spectacular mass display. The horizontal
rootstalks interlock, crowding out other
plants. A single rootstalk may extend 30 feet.
The straight, hollow stems served Indians as
arrowshafts, pipestems, and loom rods. Along
the Mexican border the leaves are woven into
mats and the long, sturdy stems are used as
screens and in roofing native houses.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower3">3.</a> Prairie spiderwort</span></h2>
<p>Because of its slender, drooping leaves, this
delicate blue-to-violet, three-petaled flower
might easily be mistaken for a lily. Plants
grow from 8 to 18 inches high. A perennial,
the spiderwort&rsquo;s thick, succulent roots enable
it to produce blossoms from April to September.
Not abundant, it is usually found in
moist locations in desert mountain ranges at
elevations above 2,500 feet. Flowers form in
clusters at the tip of a plant&rsquo;s stem, and are
pollenized by bumblebees that eat the pollen.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower4">4.</a> Desertlily</span></h2>
<p>Limited in its range to the desertlands of
southern California and southwestern Arizona,
the desertlily or ajo (AH-hoe) resembles
a small easter lily. During dry seasons
the plants do not bloom, but following wet
winters each deeply-buried bulb sends up a
vigorous shoot which may be from 6 inches
to 2 feet tall, with a bud cluster at its tip.
The delicately fragrant flowers may appear
in late February, with some tardy bloomers
still in evidence in early May. Bulbs were dug
and eaten by Indians and, because of their
flavor, were called ajo (garlic) by the Spanish
pioneers. The town of Ajo and a nearby valley
and mountain range in southwestern
Arizona were named for this plant.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower5">5.</a> Mariposa</span></h2>
<p>Similar in appearance to the segolily, State flower of Utah, weakstem mariposa,
sometimes called &ldquo;straggling butterfly lily,&rdquo; varies in color from white to pale purple.
The slender stem is not erect, like other mariposas, of which there are many species,
but wanders over the ground or makes its twisting way among the branches of low
shrubs. It grows at elevations up to 4,000 feet on slopes and benches of mountains
of the Mojave-Colorado Desert, in the Death Valley area, and in the desert mountains
of southern Arizona, blossoming during April and May. Indians and pioneers
ate the bulbs.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower6">6.</a> Golden mariposa</span></h2>
<p>Considered by some botanists as a distinct
species, this mariposa or &ldquo;butterfly tulip&rdquo; is
found in the higher mountains of the eastern
Mojave-Colorado Desert and also in the vicinity
of the Painted Desert of northern Arizona.
Common in Petrified Forest National
Park from May to July, the bright yellow
flowers make an eye-catching display among
the colorful pieces of petrified wood covering
the ground. The bulbs can withstand severe
cold, but suffer during winters when there is
frequent freezing and thawing.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower7">7.</a> Desert mariposa</span></h2>
<p>Brightest of the mariposas, the short-stemmed, flame-like flowers usually appear
singly, but may occur in patches, producing in April a spectacular display visible
from a long distance. Plants growing under bushes elongate their stems to elevate
their blossoms into the sunlight. Occasional in the Mojave-Colorado Desert, this
species is abundant in the foothills of some of southern Arizona&rsquo;s mountain ranges,
exceeding even the goldpoppy in the neon-like brilliance of display. <i>Mariposa</i> is
Spanish for butterfly, and the genus name <i>calochortus</i> is Greek for beautiful grass.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower8">8.</a> Soaptree yucca</span></h2>
<p>Common throughout the Southwest, the many species of yuccas (YUH-kuhs)
are of two major groups, the narrow-leaf and the wide-leaf. Called &ldquo;soaptree&rdquo; because
of its height (maximum 30 feet) and the fact that its roots contain saponin,
soaptree yucca or <i>palmilla</i> (pahm-EE-yah&mdash;&ldquo;little palm&rdquo;) belongs in the narrow-leaf
group. From southwestern Arizona across southern New Mexico, and from west
Texas southward into the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora, this spectacular
plant blossoms in May and June on desert grasslands from 2,000 to 6,000 foot elevations.
Cattle eat the young flower stalks, and Indians used the leaf fibers for making
fabrics, basketry, and other items. The yucca is the State flower of New Mexico.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower9">9.</a> Joshua-tree</span></h2>
<p>Another of the narrow-leaf yuccas and largest of the genus, the joshua-tree is
restricted in its range to the Mojave-Colorado Desert, of which it is the principal
indicator. Blossoms, which do not open as wide as those of other species, grow in
tight clusters at the tips of the branches, appearing in March and April. Joshuas do
not blossom every year, the interval between flowerings depending upon rainfall
and temperature. A small night lizard is dependent upon the joshua-tree, at least 25
{species of birds find nesting sites in it, and numerous insects, spiders, and scorpions
live in its dried leaves and fallen branches.}</p>

<p>Unlike the narrow-leaf soaptrees which
produce dry, capsular fruits, the wide-leaf
yuccas bear fleshy fruits which Indians cooked
and ate. Indians also used the leaf fibers in
weaving fabrics. Roots contain saponin and
the Indians still cut them up and use the
pieces for soap, especially as a shampoo. The
stiff, fleshy leaves with needle-sharp tips give
the plant the name &ldquo;Spanish bayonet.&rdquo; Torrey
yucca blooms in April in southeastern New
Mexico and west Texas, with similar plants,
<i>Yucca schottii</i> in southern Arizona, and <i>Yucca
schidigera</i> in the Mojave-Colorado Desert.</p>

<p>Massive and thick-stemmed, the locally-named
&ldquo;giant dagger&rdquo; is supposedly limited
in its native range in the United States to
Brewster County, Texas. A colony (<i>Yucca faxoniana</i>)
resembling this species has been reported
recently in McKittrick Canyon in the
Guadalupe Mountains. An extensive forest of
these spectacular plants has given the name
Dagger Flat to a broad valley in the Sierra del
Carmen of Big Bend National Park. Usually
blossoming in April, the massive, white flower
clusters gracing the crowns of thousands of
these majestic yuccas create a never-to-be-forgotten
spectacle. A small night-flying moth
is the yuccas&rsquo; pollenizing agent and, in return
for this essential service, lays her eggs in the
plants&rsquo; ovaries where the young feed on the
developing seeds.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower12">12.</a> Sacahuista</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes confused with the yuccas, the several species of &ldquo;beargrass&rdquo; or
&ldquo;basketgrass&rdquo; have pliant, grasslike leaves, small flowers, and papery fruits. The
plumelike blossom panicles open in May and June. The plants favor rocky hillsides,
and rarely occur on valley floors. Indians roasted the tender bud stalks for food, and
cattle browse the leaves when other vegetation is lacking. Mexicans, in weaving
basketry, use the entire leaves, which are especially desirable for fashioning basket
handles.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower13">13.</a> Sotol</span></h2>
<p>Also likely to be confused with the yuccas,
sotol has a basal cluster of pliant, ribbonlike
leaves edged with hooked thorns, and a tall
flower stalk bearing at its upper end a dense
panicle of small, creamy (sometimes brown)
flowers. Blossoming in May and June, the
maturing flower clusters remain attractive
throughout the summer. Mexicans split the
succulent basal crowns and allow the sap to
ferment, producing the fiery alcoholic beverage,
sotol (SOH-tole). Desert-dwelling bighorn
sheep are said to browse the tough
leaves. The stiff leaf bases, when pulled from
the cluster, form the &ldquo;desert spoons&rdquo; sold in
some curio stores.</p>

<p>Many species of agaves (ah-GAH-vees) or
&ldquo;century plants&rdquo; attract attention on desert
hillsides when they send up their tall blossom
stalks in June and July. The thick, fleshy,
sharp-tipped leaves form a basal rosette.
Some of the larger species may require 10 to
20 years to store enough plant food to produce
the sturdy, fast-growing flower stalk.
After blossoming, the exhausted plant dies.
<i>Agave scabra</i>, one of the spectacular forms, is
limited in its range to the Chisos Mountains
of Big Bend National Park, Texas.</p>

<p>Another of the large &ldquo;century plants,&rdquo; Parry
agave blooms from June to August, producing
spectacular displays on hillsides in northern
Mexico, southern New Mexico, and
southern Arizona. Some of the larger agaves
are called mescal (mess-KAHL) because of
a potent alcoholic beverage of that name distilled
from the fermented sap derived from
the bud stalks. Tequila (tee-KEEL-ah), the
famous native drink of Mexico, also is distilled
from fermented agave juices, and the
beerlike pulque (pool-KAY) has a similar
derivation. Indians roasted the bud stalks in
stone-lined pits covered with hot rocks.
Some of these pits may still be seen.</p>

<p>One of the common plants of the Chihauhuan
Desert and considered the principal indicator
of that region, lechuguilla (lay-chu-GHE-ah)
covers the ground so densely in
some places that it is impossible to walk
through it. The stiff, erect, needle-tipped,
banana-shaped leaves are a hazard to man and
beast. The flowering stalk, which blossoms in
May and June, is unbranched and flexible,
bending gracefully in the desert breeze. Deer
and cattle nip off the tender buds. Mexicans
weave the tough leaf fibers into coarse fabrics;
and the roots, called <i>amole</i>, produce suds
when rubbed in water.</p>

<p>This coarse, herbacious perennial is one of the early spring flowers of the desert,
sometimes blooming along road shoulders and in sandy washes in late February and
March. Commonly called wild rhubarb, its sap and roots are high in tannin content,
and its delicately pink fruits are more attractive than the blossoms. Indians and
Mexicans use the leaves for greens. Papago Indians of Arizona roast the leaves
and use the roots for treating colds and sore throat. This plant is a close relative of
European dock, several species of which have become naturalized in North America.</p>

bladderpod and sundrops, which grow on road shoulders and sandy flats. The
flowers are delicately fragrant, especially at night. Semi-prostrate in habit, sand-verbena

<p>Closely related to the orange California-poppy, official flower of the Golden
State, the desert species is a bright yellow annual. Following warm, wet winters clusters
of these glorious blooms dot the hillsides in late February or early March. By
April they may cover the slopes with a blanket of gold interwoven with the blue
threads of lupines and purple patches of escobita owlclover. When other early
spring vegetation is scarce, cattle graze the plants. Flowers open only during sunny
hours, remaining tightly closed at night and on cloudy days.</p>

<p>Not restricted to a desert habitat, this spiny-leafed perennial is widespread on
dry soils from Nebraska to Wyoming and from Texas to southern California and
Mexico. Abundant throughout the summer, the flowers may be found, in warm
climates, during every month of the year. Copious spines and the acrid yellow sap
make the plants distasteful to cattle, so a heavy growth of pricklepoppy may be an
indicator of an overgrazed range. Also called &ldquo;thistlepoppy,&rdquo; a single plant may be
graced by a dozen or more fragile flowers, each ready to be replaced by one or more
prickly buds. The seeds are said to contain a powerful narcotic.</p>

this showy annual blooms March to May in
dry washes and on stony hills below 4,500
feet. The foot-high plants sometimes form

is one of the long-flowering species
blooming from February to October. The
large flower heads are pleasantly fragrant,
and the peculiar, flat, double fruits resemble
tiny spectacles protruding at right angles to
the stem. This species is found in the Petrified
Forest area of northern Arizona, and
Hopi Indians are reported to use the plant
in treating wounds. Another species, California
spectaclepod, is often abundant, covering
sandy flats of the lower deserts. This species

catclaw acacia is one of the notoriously thorny shrubs or small slender trees of the
rocky hillsides and borders of desert washes. Flowers are fragrant and, during the
blooming period in May, attract many insects, including honey bees, which gather
and store nectar that makes high quality honey. The stringbean-like fruits turn red
in late summer and, if abundant, make a spectacular show. These fruits were ground
into meal and used for food by Arizona and Mexican Indians. Thickets of catclaw
acacia provide havens of refuge for birds and rabbits pursued by hawks or other

<p>Mesquite (mess-KEET) is a many-branched tree 15 to 23 feet tall, which
flowers from late April to June. It is common bordering desert washes, often forming
dense thickets. The flowers furnish honey bees and other insects with nectar,
and the long, sweet pods ripen in autumn, providing food for livestock. The fruits
have long been a staple in the diet of desert Indians, who used the trunks, roots, and
branches of the trees for firewood and the dried gum-like sap to mend pottery and
as a black dye. The inner bark provided the Indians with materials for basketry and
coarse fabrics. Roots of mesquite trees have been reported to penetrate to a depth
of 50 to 60 feet to tap sources of ground water.</p>

California, and northwestern Mexico.
There are fifteen or more other species, many
of which are found in a desert habitat and
range in size from low-growing herbs to small

desert washes, they mark these ephemeral stream courses as paths of gold
threading the open desert. During much of the year the trees are relatively leafless,
the green bark of trunk and branches taking over the function of leaves. The word

near sandy washes in the high desert. It is
especially abundant in Joshua Tree National
Monument. The name <i>adonis</i> refers to its
great beauty. The name <i>lupinus</i> is derived
from the Latin <i>lupus</i> meaning wolf, because
these plants were at one time thought to be
soil predators. Actually, as with other members
of the pea family, lupines are able to
take atmospheric nitrogen and leave it in the

At a distance it resembles a plume of smoke rising from a campfire. Its small but
violet to indigo flowers cover it with a gorgeous blue blanket in May, making it
one of the really handsome desert shrubs. It requires ample supplies of water, hence
is restricted to washes that carry runoff from both winter rains and summer downpours.
The seeds sprout readily, and the seedlings with their well-formed leaves look
very unlike their parents. Few seedlings survive the hazards of drought or being
smothered by sand carried down the washes by flash floods following cloudbursts.</p>

along sandy washes, mingling with mesquites
and paloverdes. It is particularly susceptible
to mistletoe infestation, which has killed or
weakened many fine trees. Blossoming in
May and June, the trees are sometimes laden
with lavender, wisteria-like flowers. The
wood is extremely hard and heavy, hence the
tree is locally known as &ldquo;ironwood,&rdquo; or <i>palo-de-hierro</i>,
in Mexico. Indians ate the seeds
and used the wood for tool handles and arrow-points.
Its long-burning qualities made it
especially desirable for fuel. As a result, many

Texas filaree is native to North America, but
alfileria is thought to have come from Europe

drought. Following rains its foliage gives off
a musty, resinous odor, suggestive of creosote,
stimulating the Mexican name <i>hediondilla</i>
(little stinker). In Mexico the plant is considered
to have medicinal values and many
uses. The Pima Indians boiled the leaves,
using the decoction as an emetic and to poultice
sores. They used the lac, found as an incrustation

<p>Often abundant on road shoulders and in low spots where rainwater from hot-weather
showers provides adequate moisture, &ldquo;caltrop&rdquo; or &ldquo;summerpoppy,&rdquo; with large
blossoms and attractive compound leaves, decorates the desert when other flowers
are noticeable by their absence. The long, weak stems, usually prostrate, give the
plants a vine-like appearance, but when growing under shrubs they extend upward
so that the shrub is mistakenly thought to be blooming. Superficially resembling the
springtime goldpoppy, Arizona-poppy has five rather than four petals, and may be
found in bloom as late as October.</p>

<p>Sometimes confused with tamarack because of the similarity of names, five-stamen
tamarisk, locally called &ldquo;salt-cedar,&rdquo; is one of several small tree species from
southeastern Europe and western Asia which have become naturalized in North
America. &ldquo;Salt-cedar&rdquo; often forms dense thickets on alkaline soils along stream and
reservoir banks at elevations below 5,000 feet. Flowers, which vary in hue from deep
pink to white, cover the trees with graceful plumes of color from March to August.
Although valuable in retarding soil erosion, tamarisk requires large quantities of
water, an especially undesirable characteristic in the arid Southwest.</p>

Flowers grow at ends of branches, and some species open fully only in sunlight.
A close relative, <i>Mentzelia involucrata</i>, &ldquo;sand blazing-star,&rdquo; is an annual, 4 to 16 inches

<p>Easily overlooked, when not in blossom, as a group of slender, fluted, gray-green
stems hidden beneath a shrub, this cactus is truly a glorious thing when in flower.
Beauty and fragrance of its blossoms have earned it the name, in Mexico, of <i>reina-de-la-noche</i>,
meaning &ldquo;queen-of-the-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buds unfold soon after sunset in late June or early July, perfuming the desert air
and attracting night-flying insects. They wilt soon after sunrise the following morning.
The large, tuberous root, which serves as a water-storage organ, usually weighs
from 5 to 15 pounds, but specimens have been found weighing more than 80 pounds.
Indians at one time dug the tubers for food. The bulbous fruits become red when
mature, and are almost as spectacular as the flowers. This species is found from
west Texas to western Arizona and northern Mexico.</p>

are on record. Blossoms form as huge bud clusters at the branch tips, opening a few
at a time each night, usually in May, and remain open until mid-afternoon of the
following day. Fruits of the saguaro are eaten by birds and other animals, and at
one time were important in the diet of desert Indians. The state flower of Arizona
and the subject of a US. postage stamp issued in February 1962 to commemorate
the 50th anniversary of Arizona&rsquo;s statehood, the saguaro is also commemorated and

Deserts, flowering from February
to May. Flowers close at night and reopen the
following morning. Blossoms vary considerably
in color from purple to lavender. Spines,
too, are variable, from gray and yellow to
dark brown. In southeastern California, where
it is common, this species is called &ldquo;calico

bands of alternating red and white spines encircling the single, sturdy stem.
It grows in rocky situations in the mountains of southern Arizona and northern
Mexico, blossoming from June to August. The large flowers, of which there may be
from one to four crowding around the crown of the plant, are often larger than the
plant itself. Spines are small and lie densely flat over the somewhat fluted stem,
which is from 3 to 14 inches high.</p>

<p>Massive, cylindrical, and covered with clusters of stout spines, the central one
hook-shaped, these desert giants are often mistaken for young saguaros. There are
several species, all locally called <i>bisnagas</i>, with some quite small and others attaining
a height of 5 or 6 feet. The majority produce clusters of orange to red flowers on
their crowns in late summer, but the yellow-flowered California barrel cactus blossoms
in the spring. Their tendency to lean toward the light causes many of these
heavy-bodied plants to tip in a southwesterly direction, giving them the name &ldquo;compass
cactus.&rdquo; This group is naively believed by some people to contain water. Actually
the slimy, alkaline sap obtained by mashing the pulpy flesh might conceivably save
someone lost in the desert from dying of thirst. The pale yellow fruits are not spiney,
and are eaten by birds, rodents, deer, and other desert animals.</p>

because of the shape of the plants. The
large, colorful blossoms which encircle the

plants prefer washes and benches in the desert grasslands, often growing with
paloverdes, saguaros, mesquites, and lechuguilla agaves. Excessive abundance often

on hot rocky, south-facing hillsides. Joints are extremely brittle and the barbed
spines catch so easily in the hair of animals or clothing of persons that the joints
appear to jump from the plant. Joints broken off by the wind fall to the ground and
take root in the sandy soil, gradually developing forests of this striking cactus, easily

that it is easily overlooked in a tangle of vegetation. Its flowers, appearing in May and
June, are small and inconspicuous, but the orange to scarlet fruits about the size and
shape of olives, are striking eye-catchers in the fall and winter months. In the open the
shrubby plants are rarely more than 2 feet high, but in thickets of northern Mexico
some have become almost vinelike, growing up through mesquite or paloverde trees
to a height of 12 feet or more. The species grows at elevations of 200 to 5,000 feet

ocotillo (oh-koh-TEE-yoh) is a spectacular
shrub, its many long, stiff, green-barked
and thorn-guarded stems bearing at their tips
clusters of bright red flowers from April to
June. Following rains, the stems cover themselves
with clusters of bright green leaves.
When drought comes these leaves are shed,
to be renewed again after another rain. This
procedure may be repeated half a dozen times
in one year. Cahuilla Indians eat both flowers
and seeds, and make a beverage by soaking
the blossoms in water. When planted as
hedgerows the thorny wands make an impenetrable
fence.</p>

<p>Known also as &ldquo;scorpionweed&rdquo; and &ldquo;wild
heliotrope,&rdquo; phacelia is a handsome plant
with coarse foliage, somewhat hairy and
sticky. Among other plants it often grows to
a height of 18 inches, but on dry, open desert
flats is usually much shorter. Flowers, which
may be found from February to June, are
sweet scented, but the foliage has a disagreeable
odor. <i>Crenulata</i>, which is one of many
species, grows from New Mexico and southern
Utah throughout Arizona to Lower California.
It is conspicuous among the spring-blooming
flowers of the desert. The curling
flower heads which bear some resemblance to
the erect tail of a scorpion are responsible for
the name &ldquo;scorpionweed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In favorable years these ground-hugging plants form broad, colorful mats, but
in dry seasons these annuals may be tiny, each with a single flower almost as large
as the rest of the plant. Flowering from February to May, bloom is heaviest in March
and April. This species, also called &ldquo;purplemat,&rdquo; is common on flat, sandy, open
desert soils from southeastern California and Baja California to southeastern Arizona
at elevations below 3,500 feet. Because of its low-growing habit, nama requires that
you lie prone to examine it closely, hence is one of the many small desert herbs called
&ldquo;bellyflowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Believed to be the original host of the Colorado
potato beetle, this annual is a pest on
rangelands because of its spine-covered stems

and straw-colored. It is common on desert
plains and mesas at elevations from 1,000 up
to 7,000 feet, blooming from June to August.
The leaves and unripe fruits of this and several
other species are reportedly poisonous, as
they contain an alkaloid, solanin.</p>

open fields at elevations from 1,000 to 5,500 feet from Kansas and Colorado to
Arizona, California, and south to tropical America. It is an agricultural pest in irrigated

<p>One of the really striking flowers of the deserts and mesas, the large, showy,
trumpet-shaped blossoms and broad, dark green leaves of the datura or &ldquo;western
jimson&rdquo; arouse the curiosity of persons seeing them for the first time. Quite common
along roadsides below 6,000 feet from California to Texas and Mexico, the white
blossoms remain open at night but close and droop soon after sunrise. The summer-blooming
plants often grow in large clumps with buds, flowers, and maturing fruits
all present at the same time. Indians used the plants for various medicinal purposes,
a dangerous practice, since all parts of the plant contain various alkaloids, including
atropine. Roots are narcotic and were sometimes eaten by Indians to induce visions.</p>

and arouses interest. The small, abundant, ash-gray leaves give this 3- to 4-foot
shrub a distinguished appearance throughout the year, but when it suddenly bursts
into bloom, usually in September, it becomes a thing of rare beauty. It is so sensitive
to moisture that it may blossom a few hours after a soaking rain, which gives rise to
the popular belief that it can forecast wet weather and in consequence it is sometimes
called &ldquo;barometer bush.&rdquo;</p>

throughout the higher, moister parts of the
Southwest. This one blooms in spring and
early summer below 6,000 feet from southwestern
New Mexico to southern California.
It, and the similar Parry Penstemon, are
among the more noticeable desert species
because of their showy flowers covering the

Both are fairly common on mesa slopes and
mountain canyons with individuals well
scattered, hence not contributing to the mass

is the State flower of Wyoming. The northwestern paintbrush, known in southern
California as &ldquo;desert paintbrush,&rdquo; has an extremely wide range. The flash of red
among other desert plants is actually due to the brightly colored floral bracts, as the
flowers themselves are small and inconspicuous. This species blossoms in early
spring in rocky or gravelly locations between 2,000 and 7,000 feet, on dry plains

California, and Baja California, at elevations
between 1,500 and 4,500 feet, blossoming
from March to May. Cattle and sheep

willow-like leaves, spreading branches, and a
short, crooked, black-barked trunk. The
violet-scented flowers usually appear from
April to August, often after the start of summer
rains. They are replaced by long, slender
seed pods that remain dangling from the
branches for months. Mexicans make from
the dried flowers a tea that they believe has
considerable medicinal value. Desert-willow
is usually found along desert washes below
4,000 feet from west Texas to southern California
and northern Mexico. It is frequently

foetidissima</i>, the buffalo-gourd or calabazilla. This rank-growing, ill-smelling vine-like
plant may have prostrate stems up to 20 feet long. The globular fruits, of tennis
ball size, were cooked by Indians or dried for winter consumption. Seeds were boiled
to form a pasty mush. California pioneers used the crushed roots as a cleansing agent
in washing clothes, but found that particles clinging to the cloth were a skin irritant.</p>

occurs in almost pure stands. The resinous stems burn readily, throwing off black
smoke. Most abundant on dry hills and mesas, 3,000 to 6,000 feet elevation, this
perennial is found from 1,000 to 7,000 feet, blossoming from June to October. Bees
obtain nectar and pollen from the small but densely crowded, yellow flower clusters.
The many stiff, upright branches cause some plants to appear almost globular in
shape and a foot to 2 feet in diameter. Plants of this genus are reported as poisonous
to sheep and goats if eaten in quantity, but are apparently unpalatable, as they are

is a compact, shrubby plant about 1 foot high,
with tangled branches. When fully developed
it is symmetrically globular in outline. It prefers
mesas and desert plains at elevations between
2,000 and 5,000 feet from western
New Mexico to southern California and
northern Mexico, flowering throughout the
year but most abundantly in springtime.
Sometimes called &ldquo;paper-daisy,&rdquo; the flowers
are persistent, fading to straw color and turning
papery with age. They may remain on
the stems for weeks.</p>

<h2 id="c98"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower92">92.</a> Desert baileya</span></h2>
<p>Commonly called &ldquo;desert marigold,&rdquo; baileya
blossoms in all seasons, most heavily from
March to November, and is one of the better
known flowers of the Southwest. Each circular
blossom occupies the tip of a foot-high
stem. Plants usually have a thrifty, garden-variety
appearance. They are common along
roadsides and on well-drained, gravelly slopes
up to 5,000 feet from west Texas to southeastern
California and Chihuahua. The large
flower heads are showy and the species is
cultivated in California. Cases are on record
of sheep and goats on overgrazed ranges being
poisoned by eating this plant.</p>

<h2 id="c99"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower93">93.</a> Goldfields</span></h2>
<p>Covering vast stretches of open desert with
a carpet of yellow bloom following wet winters,
goldfields is an appropriately named
spring flower found at elevations below 4,500
feet. The low-growing plant produces small
but attractive blossoms on mesas and plains,
March to May, from central and southern
Arizona to California, and Baja California.
Horses graze <i>Baeria</i> avidly, but are annoyed
by a small fly that frequents the fragrant
blossoms, giving the plant the name &ldquo;fly
flower&rdquo; in some localities.</p>

<p>Probably because it is one of the attractive
white desert flowers, chaenactis is popularly
called &ldquo;morning bride.&rdquo; A larger, yellow-flowered
species, <i>Chaenactis lanosa</i>, found on the
California deserts, is called &ldquo;golden girls.&rdquo;
Both are spring flowering annuals and, in
common with other members of the genus,
sometimes called &ldquo;pincushion plants.&rdquo; &ldquo;Morning
bride&rdquo; is often found growing about the
bases of creosotebushes, thriving at elevations
between 1,000 and 3,500 feet in southern
Nevada, western Arizona, and southeastern

<h2 id="c101"><span class="h2line1"><a id="flower95">95.</a> Douglas groundsel</span></h2>
<p>Rarely considered beautiful, the groundsels
are common and widespread, and are readily
recognized by the untidy appearance of the
large flowers which are sometimes almost 2
inches in diameter. The rather delicate,
stringy foliage is sometimes covered with
cottony threads. One species is called &ldquo;ragwort.&rdquo;
Douglas groundsel is a shrubby plant
sometimes as much as 3 feet high, common
in sandy washes and on dry foothill slopes. It
occurs from southern Utah and Arizona to
California and Mexico, between 1,000 and
6,000 feet. At lower elevations these plants
bloom at almost any time of year.</p>

<p>Everyone recognizes the thistles with their
prickly leaves and stems, and large flowers
ranging in color from white to lavender, pink
and purple. Several species grow in the
deserts, the New Mexico species being widespread
at elevations from 1,000 to 6,000 feet
in Colorado and Nevada south through New
Mexico and Arizona to California, blossoming
from March to September. Navajo and
Hopi Indians are reported to use thistles
medicinally. The nectar of some species is
eagerly sought by hummingbirds.</p>

<p>A very attractive plant, desert dandelion has several flower stalks from a few
inches to a foot tall. Some of the blossoms may be nearly 2 inches in diameter. This
annual is common in open, sandy basins, where it is a conspicuous contributor to
the spring flower spread, blooming from March through May in the creosotebush
belt of Arizona and southern California. It has been reported from as far north as
Idaho and Oregon. Sometimes a single plant has 10 or 12 flower heads in blossom at
the same time.</p>

<p>There are many species of malacothryx native to the western and southwestern
United States. Some are locally called &ldquo;desert dandelion,&rdquo; &ldquo;snake&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; &ldquo;yellow
saucers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cliff aster.&rdquo; <i>Fendleri</i> is one of the smaller species, with stems only 4
or 5 inches long, rising from a rosette of bluish-green leaves. Blooming from March
to June, this delicate relative of the common dandelion covers with its pale yellow
flowers rocky slopes and sandy plains and mesas, at elevations between 2,000 and
5,000 feet from West Texas to western Arizona.</p>

<p>Also called &ldquo;tackstem&rdquo; because of the
numerous dark-colored, tack-shaped glands
protruding from the stem, this white-flowered,
branching annual blossoms from March to
May at elevations of 500 to 4,000 feet. It is a
conspicuous item of the spring flower display
from west Texas to southern California and
northern Mexico. A similar species with yellow
flowers, <i>Calycoseris parryi</i>, common at
elevations around 3,000 feet, blooms in March
and April. It is found in southwestern Utah,
Arizona, and southern California.</p>

<p>Naturalized from Europe and generally
considered a weed, sowthistle is found in
waste grounds and along roadsides from near
sea level to 8,000 feet. It blossoms from February
to August, the flowers becoming cottony
seed heads as conspicuous as the blooms.
A close relative, <i>Sonchus oleraceus</i>, which
blossoms from March to September, produces
a gum from the drying of the sap, reportedly
a powerful cathartic. It has also been used as
a treatment for persons suffering from the
habitual use of opium derivatives.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
